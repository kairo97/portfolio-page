                About Me
            </h2>
            <p  id="my-life">
                I am a student at University of Washington full stack coding bootcamp, I was born in 1997 but have had quite a few wild experiences during those few years. I spent my early life moving around a lot, growing up with a mostly single mother and a part time father was not the easiest childhood, I have witnessed the beauty in life in some of the most unlikely of places. When I became an adult I decided to travel without a destination on a quest to find myself, and ended up in a small fishing village in Guatemala by the name of San Marcos. During my time there I made some amazing friends from all around the world and broadened my viewpoint of what is possible in this life, which in turn made me realize what I have have to offer the world. Since coming back to the US I have focused my efforts into creative endeavors, writing, acting, creating music, and recently hosting an amatuer writer's room podcast with the intention of giving a platform for those new to writing(young and old) to share their stories in a supportive enviroment, and collaborate with other writers. My most recent adventure has been learning web desgin and how to create websites with the hope of breaking into more in depth fields of coding, my hope is to one day  be able to work in the advancing world of robotic prothetics and be able to help veterans who have been disabled due to their service. The road ahead is long, but with hard work and commitment to my goals I know that anything is possible.
